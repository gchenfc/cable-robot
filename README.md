The following libraries are required:
* **Firmware/libraries/FlexCAN** - modified from unknown source (TODO: James please document this).
  There are so many FlexCAN forks for Teensy that we need to link the right one in this repo.  The

  repo.
* **ChibiOS-RT** - TODO: James add this documentation
* **wifi** - TODO: James add this documentation
